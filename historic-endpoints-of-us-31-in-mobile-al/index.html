Historic maps published by the state government, the federal government, and commercial cartographers alike agree that US 31 didn't always end at Spanish Fort; rather, the designation extended west, overlapped with US 90. And the earliest US highway route logs specify US 31's endpoint as "Mobile" (not Spanish Fort). But where precisely did US 31 terminate? This page contains all the info I've been able to find so far, but unfortunately there are still more questions than answers. Sources include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://alabamamaps.ua.edu/historicalmaps/stateroads/index.html">Alabama official state highway maps</a> (most of which I simply describe, although a couple are shown below)</li><li>USGS topo maps (various dates and scales)</li><li>Commercial maps</li></ul><p>This map may be helpful in terms of illustrating the descriptions below. I am interested in seeing any additional information that might shed light on the route of US 31 in Mobile:</p><ul><li>maps</li><li>documents</li><li>historic photos that include highway shields</li><li>etc.Â </li></ul><p>The US routes were signed in the late 1920s, but the first Mobile inset to show them (of which I'm aware) comes from the 1936 State Highway Dept. official map:</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/f5471f34-1ab6-476f-a4cf-c0c8bbdd54f8.jpg"><p>That was a few years before the Bankhead Tunnel opened. The routing of US 90 is clearly shown: after crossing Mobile Bay, it continued by heading north on Blakeley Island, and then crossed the Mobile River via the original Cochrane Bridge (which opened in 1927, in the same location as today's Cochrane-Africatown Bridge). After heading west a bit on Bay Bridge Road, it then turned south on Telegraph Road and crossed the railyards to connect with Joachim Street. Then east three blocks on St. Louis Street, south on Royal Street, west on Government Street, and out of town. The 1939 edition of the map showed this more clearly, using red strokes for highway routes:</p><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/88db6c25-6825-43db-9315-4df8853dda83.jpg"><p>Note how route designations were marked only on the map margins. That practice makes it more difficult to determine intra-city routings, and unfortunately ALDoT did that all the way through their 1970 edition.</p><p>On the right side of both maps, you can see that US 31 came across Mobile Bay with US 90, and while the route obviously ended somewhere in Mobile, it's not clear exactly where. My first guess would be that US 31 ended on Royal at Government, because the courthouse was at that intersection, and in the early days it was common for highway designations to terminate at important government buildings. In my opinion, the second-most-likely endpoint would've been the causeway landing on Blakeley Island, only because it would've been a little confusing for southbound US 31 to continue by turning north for three miles. On the other hand, it also would've been odd to overlap US 31 with US 90 all the way to that point, but then have it end without actually reaching Mobile.</p><p>1940 1:32k USGS topo: the routing indicated on the above maps was shown in greater detail here. The Bankhead Tunnel was already shown on this map (presumably because, even though it didn't open until 1941, construction began in 1938). The last US 31 marker was placed at the east tunnel entrance (from here on I'll refer to this location as BIJ, for "Blakeley Island Junction"). However, I'm skeptical that US 31 would've ended at BIJ. The Tunnel was new at the time, so I lean towards the notion that officials simply hadn't yet decided how it would affect highway routes. Backing up this theory is the fact that no US 90 shields were placed anywhere between BIJ and Broad Street, either.</p><p>1941: first ALDoT map to show the Bankhead Tunnel. This shaved about seven miles off the Cochrane Bridge - Telegraph route, but there was a toll to use the Tunnel. So mainline US 90 traffic (and probably US 31 as well) were still signed along the old route, while the Tunnel was signed as "Alternate US 90". This was also the first map to use red strokes for some major roads that were not highway routes, and the first map to show St. Louis between Joachim and Broad with a red line (no change on the 1942 or 1946 editions.) So does that mean St. Louis was a highway, or just a major road? The map below provides a clue:</p><p>1943 1:32k USGS: this showed a new viaduct over the railyards that brought Telegraph traffic straight onto St. Joseph Street (rather than Joachim). This map also indicated that US 90 no longer used Royal to get to Government. Instead, it went west on St. Louis, and then south on Broad to Government. Royal was still a red line, so it could've been US 31, but the last US 31 marker was placed at BIJ. There were two US 90 markers between there and downtown Mobile, but neither of them were accompanied by US 31 markers, suggesting that US 31 ended at BIJ. But see the next year:</p><p>1944 1:62k USGS: this indicated that US 31 went north from BIJ at least as far as the Cochrane Bridge, but how far past there is unclear.</p><p>1946 ALDoT: last map to show Royal with a red stroke.</p><p>1949 ALDoT: first map to indicate the new viaduct over the railyards that brought Telegraph traffic straight onto St. Joseph. However, Royal is no longer shown as a route. Instead, all highway traffic is shown heading west on St. Louis, then south on Broad to Government (no change on the 1954 edition). Therefore, potential endpoints for US 31 included BIJ, St. Joseph at St. Louis, St. Louis at Broad, or Broad at Government. The map below provides a clue:</p><p>1953 1:24k USGS: this indicated that US 31-90 went north from BIJ, across the Cochrane Bridge, and south on Telegraph/St. Joseph. US 43 was also marked along Telegraph, instead of its original route (see also next entry). From St. Joseph, only US 90 was shown heading west on St. Louis, but not US 31 or US 43. Royal was not shown in red, so this map suggests that both US 31 and 43 ended at the Federal Courthouse (where US 90 turned from St. Joseph onto St. Louis).</p><p>1955 ALDoT: first map since 1939 to use red strokes only for highway routes (not for other major roads), as well as the first map to show US 98 signed through Mobile. Also, this was the first to show a US 43 shield on Telegraph, in addition to its original route along Wilson - St. Stephens - Spring Hill. This reflects the fact that Telegraph was changed to mainline 43, while the original route was re-designated as Alt. US 43. So at this point it became possible (although not likely) that US 31 could've been truncated to Bay Bridge at Telegraph.</p><p>1956 Gousha (below):</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/664a40bd6a6cdd0e0af12d9f0a9ee659add8b196.jpg" alt="Gousha, c. 1956" title=""><p>Based on other maps in that series, red lines seem to have been used only for numbered highway routes... so why were Royal and Conception shown with red strokes? One possible interpretation is that US 98 followed St. Joseph - St. Louis - Spring Hill; US 90 followed St. Joseph - Dauphin - Conception - Government; and US 31 followed St. Joseph - St. Louis - Royal. This is the most detailed historic map of Mobile I've seen, but I'm not quite sure what to make of it, since not all of its particulars line up with contemporary ALDoT or USGS maps. US 43 is an example: it's shown on Spring Hill, but not on Telegraph - St. Joseph.</p><p>1957 ALDoT: first map to differentiate US routes (red strokes) from state highways (blue strokes). No change on the '58, '59, '61 editions.</p><p>1962 ALDoT: first map to show highway traffic had been directed to use Beauregard Street (rather than St. Louis) to Broad. It's possible that this is when US 43 was signed back over to its original terminus on Broad at Government. So by this time, if US 31 was still signed past BIJ, it could've ended either on Bay Bridge at Telegraph, St. Joseph at Beauregard, or Broad at Government.</p><p>1963 ALDoT: first map to show interstates 10 and 65 under construction (and of course subsequent editions show these in increasing states of completion, until the 1979 map).</p><p>1964 ALDoT: last map to show US route(s) crossing the Cochrane Bridge.</p><p>1965 ALDoT: first map to show all US routes (at least US 90-98) using the Bankhead Tunnel (instead of the Cochrane Bridge). It isn't clear whether US 31 ended at BIJ, or whether it used the Tunnel too, in which case the only possible endpoint would've been on Government at Broad. However, my suspicion is that this is when the US 31 designation was truncated to BIJ. (No change on the '67 edition.)</p><p>1967 1:24k USGS: showed the same routes as the 1953 edition, which is odd, since apparently by 1962 highway traffic was using Beauregard instead of St. Louis. Therefore this map is possibly unreliable with regard to highway routes.</p><p>1970 ALDoT: last map to show a US 31 shield on the Mobile inset.</p><p>1972 ALDoT: first map to lack any indication that US 31 entered Mobile. While this could be attributed to the fact that the scope and style of the map changed, I believe it's significant that there were no US 31 markers. To me this implies that the route couldn't have gone any farther west than BIJ.</p><p>1974 1:24k USGS: showed the same routes as the '53 and '64 editions, which is odd, since apparently by 1962 highway traffic was using Beauregard instead of St. Louis. Therefore this map is possibly unreliable with regard to highway routes.</p><p>1979 ALDoT: first map to show I-10 complete across Mobile Bay. I suspect this is when US 31 was truncated to its current terminus at Spanish Fort. Reason: there were now two causeways across Mobile Bay, so why make things more confusing than necessary by signing them with four different highway designations? Better to eliminate the redundant designation (US 31).</p><p>1981 ALDoT: first map since '64 to show a US route using the Cochrane Bridge (Alt US 90).</p><p>1982 1:24k USGS: Alt. US 90 was the only US route shown using the Cochrane Bridge. This map finally showed the highway routing along Beauregard (instead of St. Louis), but it carried only US 43 (not US 31). In fact, there were no US 31 shields at all on the Mobile quad, but on the adjacent quad to the east there was a US 31 marker on the Causeway, implying that it couldn't have gone any farther than BIJ.</p><p>Again, this map might help to clarify all this. This page has photos and more information about historic endpoints at the Government/Broad intersection. Or, you can go back to the main US 31 page.</p><p>Additional research and/or photo credits: Nathan Edgars</p></div></section></div><section id="2" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="15"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="16"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="17"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="18"><span data-reactid="19"><!-- react-empty: 20 --><h2 data-reactid="21"><a data-reactid="22">usends</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="23"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="24"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="25"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="26"></div></section></div></div>
