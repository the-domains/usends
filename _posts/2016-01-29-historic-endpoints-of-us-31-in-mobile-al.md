Battleship Parkway is the original 1926 causeway across Mobile Bay (prior to that, automobile traffic had to use ferries between Mobile and Daphne and/or Fairhope). Historic maps published by the state government, the federal government, and commercial cartographers alike agree that US 31 didn't always end at Spanish Fort; rather, the designation extended west, overlapped with US 90\. And the earliest US highway route logs specify US 31's endpoint as "Mobile" (not Spanish Fort). But where precisely did US 31 terminate? This page contains all the info I've been able to find so far, but unfortunately there are still more questions than answers. Sources include:

* Alabama official state highway maps (most of which I simply describe, although a couple are shown below)
* USGS topo maps (various dates and scales)
* Commercial maps

This map may be helpful in terms of illustrating the descriptions below. I am interested in seeing any additional information that might shed light on the route of US 31 in Mobile:

* maps
* documents
* historic photos that include highway shields
* etc. 

The US routes were signed in the late 1920s, but the first Mobile inset to show them (of which I'm aware) comes from the 1936 State Highway Dept. official map:
![ALDoT, c. 1936](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/90cd1074-7390-4961-895b-90b5fdeb3519.jpg)

That was a few years before the Bankhead Tunnel opened. The routing of US 90 is clearly shown: after crossing Mobile Bay, it continued by heading north on Blakeley Island, and then crossed the Mobile River via the original Cochrane Bridge (which opened in 1927, in the same location as today's Cochrane-Africatown Bridge). After heading west a bit on Bay Bridge Road, it then turned south on Telegraph Road and crossed the railyards to connect with Joachim Street. Then east three blocks on St. Louis Street, south on Royal Street, west on Government Street, and out of town. The 1939 edition of the map showed this more clearly, using red strokes for highway routes:

Note how route designations were marked only on the map margins. That practice makes it more difficult to determine intra-city routings, and unfortunately ALDoT did that all the way through their 1970 edition.

On the right side of both maps, you can see that US 31 came across Mobile Bay with US 90, and while the route obviously ended somewhere in Mobile, it's not clear exactly where. My first guess would be that US 31 ended on Royal at Government, because the courthouse was at that intersection, and in the early days it was common for highway designations to terminate at important government buildings. In my opinion, the second-most-likely endpoint would've been the causeway landing on Blakeley Island, only because it would've been a little confusing for southbound US 31 to continue by turning north for three miles. On the other hand, it also would've been odd to overlap US 31 with US 90 all the way to that point, but then have it end without actually reaching Mobile.

1940 1:32k USGS topo: the routing indicated on the above maps was shown in greater detail here. The Bankhead Tunnel was already shown on this map (presumably because, even though it didn't open until 1941, construction began in 1938). The last US 31 marker was placed at the east tunnel entrance (from here on I'll refer to this location as BIJ, for "Blakeley Island Junction"). However, I'm skeptical that US 31 would've ended at BIJ. The Tunnel was new at the time, so I lean towards the notion that officials simply hadn't yet decided how it would affect highway routes. Backing up this theory is the fact that no US 90 shields were placed anywhere between BIJ and Broad Street, either.

1941: first ALDoT map to show the Bankhead Tunnel. This shaved about seven miles off the Cochrane Bridge - Telegraph route, but there was a toll to use the Tunnel. So mainline US 90 traffic (and probably US 31 as well) were still signed along the old route, while the Tunnel was signed as "Alternate US 90". This was also the first map to use red strokes for some major roads that were not highway routes, and the first map to show St. Louis between Joachim and Broad with a red line (no change on the 1942 or 1946 editions.) So does that mean St. Louis was a highway, or just a major road? The map below provides a clue:
